# ITMS - IIUC Transport Managemet System

This software is made as per requirement of IIUC TMD - IIUC Transport Management Division. 

It helps the TMD to calculate the student at per route and the system automatically allocate the required bus as per route. 
Admins can publish notice and bus schedule immediately. 
It helps to distribute buses equally as per requirement and helps to sort out the pressure on a bus, driver and helper weekly monthly and yearly.

It also helps to track all bus information their important time table and necessary thing i.e. insurance, route permit etc. validity date and its issue time. 

For some operation it is time consuming but the research to reduce the complexity of computing is a continuous process. 
We are still working to reduce the time complexity O(n) to O(log n) or O(1).

But we can ensure that it will reduce most of the hassles regarding IIUC Transportaion.
